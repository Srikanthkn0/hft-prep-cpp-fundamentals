This repository tracks my journey toward **high-frequency trading (HFT)** by practicing C++ through small console programs.[page:1]
It currently contains basic algorithms and utilities like GCD, factorial, number reversal, string utilities, and simple calculators.[page:1]
Over time, this will evolve toward more performance-oriented and HFT-relevant components as my skills grow.
